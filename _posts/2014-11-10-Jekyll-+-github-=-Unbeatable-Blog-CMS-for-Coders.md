I'm loving this [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll) thing. You won't see many pull requests from me, but this thing sure is an efficient blogging tool.

And thank you [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark)! Your [Jekyll-Now](https://github.com/barryclark/Jekyll-Now) example made it a cinch to get started. You should have a lot more forks coming soon as my friends and mentees start using it.
