title: Finally, A Free, Decent-Looking Blog Template

I'm loving this [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll) thing. You won't see many pull requests from me, but this thing sure is an efficient blogging tool.

And thank you [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark)! Your Jekyll-Now example made it a cynch to get started. You should have a lot more forks coming soon as my friends and mentees start using it.
