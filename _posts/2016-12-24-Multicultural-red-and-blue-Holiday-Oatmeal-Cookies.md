# Gluten-Free Oatmeal Cookies

I modified the [Blueberry Oatmeal Cookie recipe on AllRecipes](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/231981/blueberry-oatmeal-cookies/) to make it a bit more healthy and colorful for the holidays. I gave it more antioxidants and used less refined sugar and salt, and no wheat flour. And, of course, I doubled everything.

Start preheating the oven to 350 deg F (175 deg C), then beat (whip) sugar and fat together. I used canola and olive oil (unsalted butter or margarine work well too). Beat in maple syrup and brown sugar.

* 1 cup canola oil unsalted butter, softened
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 1/2 cup maple sugar
* 1 Tbsp molasses (to taste)

Beat the egg and vanilla in last. Their chemical bonds are more fragile.

* 2 eggs
* 2 tsp vanilla extract

Next, mix the dry ingredients with the flour (but not the oats, yet).

* 2 tbsp cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 2 cup brown rice flour (or wheat flour)

Stir in the oil/fat with a whisk, but not too much (to avoid breaking down the heat-activated part of the double-acting baking powder). Fold in the oats next.

* 1 cup old-fashioned rolled oats
* 1 cup quick-cook oats (to help stick together)

Add blueberries and cranberries to taste. Keep adding more oats until the blobs stay put on a baking sheet.

* 1 1/2 cup frozen blueberries
* 1 cup dry cranberries

I tried adding Gheridelli dark chocolate chips, but they overwhelmed the cranberry and blueberries, so I don't recommend that.

Lightly squeeze the dough between two large dinner table spoons as your drop them onto onto a greesed (sprayed with canola or olive oil) baking sheet or pan. That may help them stick together. Bake at 350 deg F (175 deg C) for 15 minutes on the top rack. If you bake it one sheet at a time (for more consistent results), keep the dough in the fridge between batches.
