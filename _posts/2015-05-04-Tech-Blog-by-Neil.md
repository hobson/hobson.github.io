Keeping Up
----------

If you want to keep up with the latest in tech, [N]eil's blog](http://www.brazilostrich.com/) isn't a bad place to check out now and then, the slides [section in particular](http://www.brazilostrich.com/?p=346). Thanks for mentioning my Python User Group talk slides. I really have to update the slides.com ones I built with the GUI so that they can be easily embedded in blogs like Neil's. Remind me to cancel my slides.com subscription and rewrite them in raw reveal.js code.

Getting Perspective
-------------------

If you like a little perspective and art with your tech, then check out Steven Skoczen's blog and newsletter at [Ink and Feet](http://inkandfeet.com). I'm regularly refreshed with that feeling of being alive when I read his weekly letter... it's like you feel in those serene moments on travel alone in a foreign country. Only you get to be safe at home on your couch or in bed, which he endures the traveler's sickness and isolation of living among people whose language he's yet to learn.
