title: Linux Phone for Christmas
---

I'm excited about my new Christmas present for myself, a linux phone.
Really hope I can cut down on the distractions and manipulations by my OS and app providers.
And I may soon be able to integrate [nlpia-bot](github.com/nlpia/nlpia-bot) into it (after I finish plugging it up to [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/web/accounts/1019390).
The decision between the [Pine64 PinePhone](https://www.pine64.org/pinephone/) and the Libre Phone developer edition was a no brainer for a tinkerer like me.
