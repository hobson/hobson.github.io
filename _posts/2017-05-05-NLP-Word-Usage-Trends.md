Here are some example [Google N-gram Viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams) queries that I used while researching the [NLP in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/natural-language-processing-in-action?a_aid=totalgood&a_bid=19bd201b) book, including one to decide how to spell "n-gram" ;)

## Queries

- Which should the acronym "LDA" refer to? [Linear Discriminant Analysis,Latent Dirichlet Allocation](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=Linear+Discriminant+Analysis%2CLatent+Dirichlet+Allocation&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2CLinear%20Discriminant%20Analysis%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CLatent%20Dirichlet%20Allocation%3B%2Cc0)

- Best spelling for "TF-IDF"? [TF-IDF,TFIDF,tfidf](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=TF-IDF%2CTFIDF%2Ctfidf&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2CTF%20-%20IDF%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CTFIDF%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Ctfidf%3B%2Cc0)

- Trends in AI & NLP research? [AI,Artificial Intelligence,NLP,Bot,Machine Learning,finite state,syntax,Logic](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=AI%2CArtificial+Intelligence%2CNLP%2CBot%2CMachine+Learning%2Cfinite+state%2Csyntax%2CLogic&year_start=1860&year_end=2008&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2CAI%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CArtificial%20Intelligence%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CNLP%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CBot%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CMachine%20Learning%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cfinite%20state%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Csyntax%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2CLogic%3B%2Cc0)
