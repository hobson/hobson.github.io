title: Use Artificial Neural Net to Predict Weather
---

I tried to build a neural net with [`pybrain`](http://pybrain.org/) to predict the weather, but fell short before I had to present the lightening talk. So this weekend I finished it up. The [`pug-ann`](http://github.com/hobson/pug-ann) package in the [`pug`](http://github.com/hobson/pug) namespace package now has a decent weather prediction example and weather data retrieval tool if you want to try it on your city.
