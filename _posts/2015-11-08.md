title: Inspiring Night -- John Irving Explaining his Craft
---

It was inspiring, almost magical, electic, listening to John Irving explain his art, his insight into life, at Portland Art Museum where OPB hosted him with the church organ of the First Congregational United Church of Christ as a backdrop.

Irving shared the universal secret of crafting suspense into his stories. He tries to reveal just enough about the one or two big plot twists/tragedies to make them not seem hokey, but not so much that they spoil the suspense. He asks his wife to be his first reader if she tells him if something was too revealing/obvious or too hokey he gets a couple others to read it (like his editor) and then if they spontaneously say the same thing he takes a bit of foreshadowing out or adds some back in. Crafting away the "hokiness" was what impressed me. That is the most critical element to making any story engaging, the surprise, the foreshadowing. That sense that everything makes sense in the end, even in tragedy.

And Irving's favorite authors for nonhoakiness foreshadowing are Shakespear and Melville. They strike the balance perfectly, as in Moby Dick with Queque the native cannibal flakey superstitious harpoonist that has the carpenter crafting him a coffin and then deciding that he's not going to die after the coffin is built and then the coffin being used as a "life bouy." "And who doesn't know that the sip is not coming home?" But we all hope that it will up until it doesn't. And then realize that it was obvious. That was a mix of foreshadowing that is easily understood/accepted and hints so complicated that it is only obvious after the fact.

And in Shakespeare when Richard is whining about "my kingdom for a horse" and self-pitying and then in the end is feeling helpless and running away in fear, insecurity. That is an example of knowing the end and anticipating it in the voice of your character but making sure the voice evolves throughout the story and your main character grows/changes. The passage of time is the key difference between a novel and a screen play. It's only because he was able to copress Cider House Rules into an 18 month story from 15 years that he could see that it would make a movie. Other stories, like his latest where the only recognizable characteristic of the draft dodger at the end of the novel is his limp and everything else about him has changed.  Having to change actors throughout a play to show the passage of time, aging isn't believable for Irving.
