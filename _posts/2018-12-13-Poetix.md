A big thanks to [Philip R. Baldwin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philip-baldwin-1658905/) for sharing this clever [AI-generated sonnet](https://youtu.be/wUFflUsK7Dw).

It's one of the winners of Dartmouth's Poetix competition.

It's pretty funny, and not completely irrelevant to the sense that we're all being "dumbe down" down by the Intenet and AI, as they take over more and more of our intellectual chores.
