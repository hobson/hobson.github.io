title: Awesome-Data-Mining-Introduction
---

I loved this blog post by [Raymond Li](http://rayli.net) that [Aleck](http://www.slideshare.net/AleckLandgraf) forwarded  to tonight: [Top 10 Data Mining Algorithms](http://rayli.net/blog/data/top-10-data-mining-algorithms-in-plain-english/). It's approachable even by people who've never used any of these tools. And yet it's so rich with information that I learned about some new techniques I'd never heard of and it cleared up some misconceptions I had about some algorithms (SVMs in particular).
