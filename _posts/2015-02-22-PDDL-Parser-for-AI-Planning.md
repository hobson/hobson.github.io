title: PDDL Parser for AI Planning
---

If you need to parse PDDL for the AI Planning class at coursera, check [this repo](https://github.com/hobson/coursera/blob/master/aiplan/pddl.py). It's pretty basic and hasn't been tested on the DWR problem descriptions, but I'm really enjoying playing around with my first "compiler". I'm sure everything I've done is all wrong, but the [`pyparsing`](http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/HowToUsePyparsing) package is very intuitive and forgiving.
