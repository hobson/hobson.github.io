title: PDDL Parser for AI Planning
---

If you need to parse PDDL for the AI Planning class at coursera, check out [this script](https://github.com/hobson/coursera/blob/master/aiplan/pddl.py). It's pretty basic and hasn't been tested on the DWR problem descriptions, but I'm really enjoying playing around with my first "compiler". I'm sure I've done things the "wrong way", but the [`pyparsing`](http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/HowToUsePyparsing) package is very intuitive and seems forgiving of my mistakes.
