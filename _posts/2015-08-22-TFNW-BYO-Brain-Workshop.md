# Biological Brains

Neuroscientists simulated a [whole brain](http://openbrain.org)

. . .

... of a nematode worm (C Elegans)

~300 neurons

~200 in central nervous system

---

![C Elegans<br>Most photographed organism of all time?](/images/BYOB-CelegansGoldsteinLabUNC.jpg)

---

## Pretend Brains

Artificial brains aren't at all like human brains,

. . .

or even a worm brain

Neuron simulations are broad abstractions
    - pulses in time not modeled
    - chemistry
    - neuron internal feedback loops

<div><asside class="notes">
  The "artificial" in AI is being replaced by "Machine"<br>
  Or you can think of artifical as "pretend".
  Or a model.
  Like the model you have in your head for how the economy or the world works.<br>
  If you are nice people will be nice to you.
  If you work hard, you'll get paid by your boss.
  <br>

## Brain? Really?

No, not *really*.
Just pretend.
In a computer.


<div><asside class="notes">
  Zeke pointed out that we're not building a brain, but an approximate model of a brain, an abstraciton<br>
  What you build today won't be able to have a conversation with you, but it might be able to tell you whether to bring your umbrella to work on Monday.<br>
  And it won't act in the physical world (except the light emitted from your laptop LEDs)<br>
</asside></div>

---

## Abstraction

* 18th century: stars modeled as crystal spheres
* Copernicus: Earth at the center

<div><asside class="notes">
  Too much complexity can hide the truth.<br>
  In the middle ages they could predict the motions of the stars to a few degrees<br>
  Now we can predict satellites, planets, stars to microradians (millimeters for satellites)
</asside></div>

## Math

- You don't need to know Linear Algebra, just...
    - multiply
    - add
    - check thresholds
- Equation/code is short (in python)
- 100s of neurons
    - Not billions
- Train for minutes
    - Not decades

---

## McCulloch Pitts Neuron (MCP)

Modeled after biological neurons.
Can be combined to perform any logical or mathematical operation.

Binary output: 0 or +1
Any Number of **binary** inputs
Inhibitory input with "veto" power

---

## Rosenblatt's Perceptron

Designed to be "trainable"
Rosenblatt provided a training algorithm

Binary output: **-1** or +1
Any number of real inputs
Threshold = 0
Weights and inputs can be real-valued

---

## Modern Neurons

---

## Activation functions

- sigmoid
- saturation
- threshold
- linear
- sync
- tanh

---

## Priorities Matter

- Neanderthals' big eyes likely drove them to extinction[^2]
- Too much of a good thing
    - Less room for imagination
    - Less neurons for social interaction

![Neanderthals' large eyes may have hurt their chances](/images/BYOB-Kermanshah_Pal_Museum-Neanderthal.jpg)

## Lesson: Depth Wins

A deeper brain may be better

than

High resolution sensing

---

## Layers

- Many layers (6+ for)
- Many neurons/layer
- Sophisticated Connection Architectures
    - fully-connected
    - convolutional
    - recursive
    - sparse
    - random
    - scale-free

---

## Neural Nets were "made" for ...<br>Hyperdimensionality

- Images (object recognition)
- Sound (speech recognition)
- Time series (weather, finance, election prediction)

---

## Pattern Recognition

> - Prediction
> - Segmentation (sound, image)
> - Feature detection
> - Fraud detection
> - Intrusion detection
> - Game cheating detection
. . .

But often they can produce useful features
that seemingly don't make sense

. . .

except for images

---

## Neural Nets help when ...

---

## You don't know what to look for<br>(feature engineering)

- FFT
- DCT
- Wavelets
- PCA/SVD
- RF
- Statistics (mean, std, diff, polynomial)
- LPF/BPF/HPF
- Resampling/Interpolation/Extrapolation

---

## And when ...

---

## Conventional control laws fail

- shooting a basketball
- kicking a soccer ball
- stabilizing an inverted pendulum
- helicopter stunts

---

## Neural Nets can help invert "Physics" models

- Infer reflectance despite shadow/glare/haze
- 2-D image -> 3-D object
- When direct measurement of 3-D not possible
    - stereoscopic vision
    - structured light
    - lidar
    - radar
    - sonar
    - Kinect or RealSense

---

## NNs "see" through structured noise

Both images and sound often suffer from

- occlusion
- obsucration/haze/fog/fade
- rotation/translation/warping

---

## NNs need data and power

- Lots of examples to learn from
- CPU/GPU cycles to burn
    - Google speech recognition doesn't run on your phone...yet

---

# Layers

---

## Classification

The most basic ML task is classification

In NN lingo, this is called "association"

So lets predict "rain" (1) "no rain" (0) for PDX tomorrow

---

## Supervised Learning

We have historical "examples" of rain and shine

[Weather Underground](http://wunderground.org)

Since we know the classification (training set)...

Supervised classification (association)

---

## Rain, Shine, Partly-Cloudy ?

Wunderground lists several possible "conditions" or classes

If we wanted to predict them all

We would just make a binary classifier for each one

All classification problems can be reduced a binary classification

---

## [*Perceptron*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron)

Sounds mysterious, like a "flux capacitor" or something...

It's just a multiply and threshold check:

{% highlight python %}
if (weights * inputs) > 0:
    output = 1
else:
    output = 0
{% endhighlight %}

---

## Need something a little better

Works fine for "using" (*[activating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function)*) your NN

But for learning (*[backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation)*) you need it to be predictable...

* doesn't change direction on you: *[monotonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonic_function)*
* doesn't jump around: *[smooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothness)*

---

## [*Sigmoid*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron)

Again, sounds mysterious... like a transcendental function

It is a transcendental function, but the word just means

Curved, smooth like the letter "C"

---

## What Greek letter do you think of when I say "Sigma"?

## "Î£"

What Roman (English) character?

* "E"?
* "S"?
* "C"?

---

## [Sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma)

You didn't know this was a Latin/Greek class, did you...

Î£ (uppercase)
Ï (lowercase)
Ï (last letter in word)
c (alternatively)

---

Most English speakers think of an "S"

when they hear "Sigma".

So the meaning has evolved to mean S-shaped.

---

## Shaped like an "S"

The trainer (*(backpropagator)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation]*) can predict the change in `weights` required
Wants to nudge the `output` closer to the `target`

`target`: known classification for training examples
`output`: predicted classification your network spits out

---

## But just a nudge.

Don't get greedy and push all the way to the answer
Because your linear sloper predictions are wrong
And there may be nonlinear interactions between the weights (multiply layers)

So set the learning rate (\alpha) to somthething less than 1
the portion of the predicted nudge you want to "dial back" to

---

# Code

---

## Example: Predict Rain in Portland

* PyBrain
* pug-ann (helper functions TBD PyBrain2)

---

## Visualizing a Brain[^3]

- watch the weights evolve
- activate with examples and watch intermediate layers

[^3]: http://cs231n.github.io/understanding-cnn/

---

![Output column heatmap]BYOB-W_output_column.png)

---

![Input row heatmap]BYOB-W_output_column.png)

---

## Get historical weather for Portland then ...

1. Backpropagate: train a perceptron
2. Activate: predict the weather for tomorrow!

---

## NN Advantages

* Easy
    * No math!
    * No tuning!
    * Just plug and chug.
* General
    * One model can apply to many problems
* Advanced
    * They often beat all other "tuned" approaches

---

## Disadvantage #1: Slow to Learn

* cubic to learn
    + quadratic to activate

---

## Example

* 24+ hr for complex Kaggle example on laptop
* 90x30x20x10 ~= 1M DOF
    + 90 input dimensions (regressors)
    + 30 nodes for *hidden layer* 1
    + 20 nodes for *hidden layer* 2
    + 10 output dimensions (predicted values)

---

## Disadvantage #2: They don't often scale (difficult to parallelize)

* Fully-connected NNs can't be *easily* hyper-parallelized (GPU)
    * Large matrix multiplications
    * Layers depend on all elements of previous layers

---

## Scaling Workaround

At Kaggle workshop we discussed paralleling linear algebra

  * Split matrices up and work on "tiles"
  * Theano, [Keras]() for python
  * [PLASMA](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/news_pub/submissions/plasma-scidac09.pdf) for BLAS

---

## Scaling Workaround Limitations

But tiles must be shared/consolidated and theirs redundancy

  * Data flow: Main -> CPU -> GPU -> GPU cache (and back)
  * Data com (RAM xfer) is limiting
  * Data RAM size (at each stage) is limiting
  * [Each GPU is equivalent to 16 core node](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/news_pub/submissions/plasma-scidac09.pdf)

---

## Disadvantage #3: They overfit

* Too manu nodes = overfitting

---

## What is the big O?

* Degrees of freedom grow with number of nodes & layers
* Each layer's nodes connected to each previous layer's
* That a lot of wasted "freedom"
* Many weights are randomly zeroed/ignored (Random Dropout)

## O(N^2) to activate
## O(N^3) to learn

---

## Not so fast, big O...

{% highlight python %}
>>> np.prod([30, 20, 10])
6000
>>> np.sum([30, 20, 10])**2
3600
{% endhighlight %}


---

## Rule of thumb

NOT `N**2`

But `M * N**2`

N: number of nodes
M: number of layers

---

## Automated Architecture Limits

`assert(M * N**2 < len(training_set) / 10.)`

I'm serious... put this into your code.
I wasted a lot of time training models for Kaggle that was overfit.

---

You do need to know math!

* To imprint your net with the structure (math) of the problem
    * Feature analysis or transformation (conventional ML)
    * Choosing the activation function and segmenting your NN
* Prune and evolve your NN

---

This is a virtuous cycle!

* More structure (no longer fully connected)
    * Each independent path (segment) is parallelizable!
* Automatic tuning, pruning, evolving is all parallelizable!
    * Just train each NN separately
    * Check back in with Prefrontal to "compete"

---

Structure you can play with (textbook)

+ limit connections

jargon: *receptive fields*

+ limit weights

jargon: *weight sharing*

All the rage: *convolutional networks*

---

Unconventional structure to play with

New ideas, no jargon yet, just crackpot names

* limit weight ranges (e.g. -1 to 1, 0 to 1, etc)
* weight "snap to grid" (snap learning)

---

Joke: "What's the difference between a scientist and a crackpot?"

---

Ans: "P-value"

* High-**P**robability null hypothesis
* Not **P**ublished
* Not **P**eer-reviewed
* No **P**yPi **p**ackage

I'm a crackpot!
