title: Comparison of Hybrid Mobile App Javascript Frameworks
---

[Zak](http://totalgood.org/bicycle) and [I](http://totalgood.org/hope) are building frontends for DRF that we'd like to go mobile with eventually.

So choosing between React and Angular hinges on the hybrid app framework alternatives (ReactNative or Ionic).

Ionic is more mature but it's app ["showcase"](http://ionicframework.com/) is no more impressive than [ReactNative](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/showcase.html)'s

So I guess I'll go with the latest hottness (React) and let Zak use the more standard Angular.
