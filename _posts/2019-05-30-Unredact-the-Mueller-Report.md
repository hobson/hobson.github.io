title: Unredact the Mueller Report?
---

What if the latest language models from Google were so good that they could unredact the Mueller Report? We gave it a shot at the monthly Portland Python User Group for May. BERT came up with some surprising results. The slides and code are here: [PDF](https://github.com/tfw/blob/master/talk-portland-python-user-group-05-30-manceps-branding.pdf?raw=true) [ODP](https://github.com/tfw/blob/master/talk-portland-python-user-group-05-30-manceps-branding.odp?raw=true) [py](https://github.com/manceps/tfw/tree/master/examples/muellerbot)

Spoiler alert: David Berstein is not likely the name Trump minions redacted from the Mueller report. But there's a decent chance he appeared in Google News articles over the past decade along side the names Trump, Cohen and the other lawyers mentioned in the redacted report.
