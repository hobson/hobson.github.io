title: Predictive Analytics War Stories Video
---

Thank you, [David Barton](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=100854240) and [Innovation Enterprise](ieonline.com) for recording my [presentation](http://youtu.be/8n338W0yvoM) at the Predictive Analytics Summit in San Diego. Really knocks down my ego a notch to see my awkwardness on tape (like hearing your voice on an answering machine) and motivates me to improve.

The [video](http://youtu.be/8n338W0yvoM) above not much use for anything or anyone else--you can't see the slides with all the pretty I'm pointing at. I'll happily edit the video to superimpose the slides if anyone thinks it might be useful. Here's the [full version of the slides](//slides.com/hobsonlane/data-analytics-war-stories/) at slides.com in an interractive format that allows comments and drag/mouse-over within the iframes. A pdf version of the slides is available [here](/images/Hobson-Lane-Predictive-Analytics-Innovation-Summit-San-Diego-2015.pdf).
