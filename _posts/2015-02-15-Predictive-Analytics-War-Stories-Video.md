title: Predictive Analytics War Stories Video
---

Thank you [David Barton](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=100854240) and [Innovation Enterprise](//ieondemand.com) for recording my [presentation](http://youtu.be/8n338W0yvoM) at the [Predictive Analytics Summit](http://theinnovationenterprise.com/summits/predictive-analytics-innovation-summit-san-diego2015/schedule) in San Diego. It really knocked down my ego a notch to see my awkwardness. You've motivated me to practice.

The [video](http://youtu.be/8n338W0yvoM) doesn't show the screen with the [reveal.js slides](//slides.com/hobsonlane/data-analytics-war-stories/). But if you check out the slides at [slides.com](//slides.com/hobsonlane/data-analytics-war-stories/) you'll get all the plots, animations, interactive d3 visulizations, and even commenting on individual slides. If anyone requests it, I'll superimpose the slides onto the video.

Here's a [pdf of the slides](/images/Hobson-Lane-Predictive-Analytics-Innovation-Summit-San-Diego-2015.pdf), and here's the [github repo](https://github.com/sharplabs/analytics-summit-2015) with the [reveal.js + Choose-Your-Own-Adventure](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2014/11/choose-your-own-adventure-presentations-with-reveal-js-python-and-websockets.html) SMS vote-tallying flask webapp that [Matt Makai](http://www.mattmakai.com/) came up with.
