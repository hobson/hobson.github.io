title: Predictive Analytics War Stories Video
---

Thank you, [David Barton](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=100854240) and [Innovation Enterprise](//ieondemand.com) for recording my [presentation](http://youtu.be/8n338W0yvoM) at the [Predictive Analytics Summit](http://theinnovationenterprise.com/summits/predictive-analytics-innovation-summit-san-diego2015/schedule) in San Diego. It really knocked down my ego a notch to see my awkwardness. You motivated me to practive a bit more next time.

The [video](http://youtu.be/8n338W0yvoM) above not much use for anything or anyone else--you can't see the slides with all the pretty I'm pointing at. I'll happily edit the video to superimpose the slides if anyone thinks it might be useful. Here's the [full version of the slides](//slides.com/hobsonlane/data-analytics-war-stories/) at slides.com in an interractive format that allows comments and drag/mouse-over within the iframes. A pdf version of the slides is available [here](/images/Hobson-Lane-Predictive-Analytics-Innovation-Summit-San-Diego-2015.pdf).
