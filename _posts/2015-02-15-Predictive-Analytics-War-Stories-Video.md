title: Predictive Analytics War Stories Video
---

Thank you, [David Barton](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=100854240) and [Innovation Enterprise](//ieondemand.com) for recording my [presentation](http://youtu.be/8n338W0yvoM) at the [Predictive Analytics Summit](http://theinnovationenterprise.com/summits/predictive-analytics-innovation-summit-san-diego2015/schedule) in San Diego. It really knocked down my ego a notch to see my awkwardness. You motivated me to practive a bit more next time.

The [video](http://youtu.be/8n338W0yvoM) above not much use for anything or anyone else--you can't see the slides with the plots, animations, and interactive d3 visulaizations. I'll happily edit the video to superimpose the slides if anyone thinks it might be useful. Here's the [full version of the reveal.js deck](//slides.com/hobsonlane/data-analytics-war-stories/) at slides.com that allows comments interraction within the iframes. A pdf version of the slides is available [here](/images/Hobson-Lane-Predictive-Analytics-Innovation-Summit-San-Diego-2015.pdf).
