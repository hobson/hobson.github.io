title: PyCon 2015 -- Predict Weather with PyBrain, Attribution Do-Over

Here's my attribution "do-over" for my PyCon 2015 [lightning talk](https://youtu.be/9LOGjet1lFk). I didn't even capitalize [PyBrain](http://pybrain.org) correctly. So here's my belated thank you to [Lynn Root](http://www.roguelynn.com/) for herding us Lighting Talk cats with grace, and the videographer and sound crew that pulled off this technical juggling act without once dropping a ball. And a big thanks to the [PyBrain](http://pybrain.org) [creators](http://pybrain.org/pages/contact) led by [IDSIA Professor JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/), [contributors](https://github.com/pybrain/pybrain/graphs/contributors), and [supporters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pybrain/pybrain/master/acknowledgements.txt). PyBrain is an awesome library. My talk, and work for my employer, wouldn't have been possible without it. I can only blame my attribution FAIL on public speaking nerves and my inabiility to maintain a stable WiFi connection as I tried to create the slides in the seconds leading up to podium time.

Here are the [latest slides](/images/pycon2015-predict-weather-with-pybrain.html). As soon as I can my slides being held hostage by slides.com (recreate as straight HTML5+reveal.js) I'll add the appropriate attribution throughout the presentation.

And here's the [pug-ann repo](http://github.com/hobson/pug-ann) where I'd love to get pull requests or give write privileges to contributors. Help me build a truly autonomous (self-tuning) neural net predictor. It's a race against the big boys to make open-source, open-data AI that can beat them at their game..
