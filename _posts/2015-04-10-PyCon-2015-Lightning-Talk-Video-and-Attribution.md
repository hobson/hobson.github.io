title: PyCon 2015 -- Predict Weather With [pybrain](//github.com/pybrain/pybrain)
---

Epic attribution fail at my PyCon 2015 [lightning talk](https://youtu.be/9LOGjet1lFk). Thank you [Lynn Root](http://www.roguelynn.com/) for herding us Lighting Talk cats with grace, and the videographer and sound crew that pulled off this technical juggling act without a dropping a ball. And a big thanks to the [PyBrain](http://pybrain.org) creators, [contributors](https://github.com/pybrain/pybrain/graphs/contributors) and [supporters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pybrain/pybrain/master/acknowledgements.txt) for building an awesome library. My talk (and work for my employer) wouldn't have been possible without it. I can only blame my attribution FAIL on nerves and my inabiility to maintain a stable WiFi connection as I tried to create the slides in the seconds leading up to podium time. 

Here are the [latest slides](/images/pycon2015-predict-weather-with-pybrain.html). As soon as I can my slides being held hostage by slides.com (recreate as straight HTML5+reveal.js) I'll add the appropriate attribution throughout the presentation.

And here's the [pug-ann repo](http://github.com/hobson/pug-ann) where I'd love to get pull requests or give write privileges to contributors. Help me build a truly autonomous (self-tuning) neural net predictor. It's a race against the big boys to make open-source, open-data AI that can beat them at their game..
