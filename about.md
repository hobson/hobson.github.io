I'm a software developer, data scientist and robotics engineer in Portland Oregon.

### Passion for AI

Artificial Intelligence (machine intelligence, autonomous agents, machine learning, super-intelligence, or whatever you call it) has been my passion since the first day I put my fingers to the gray chiclet keys of a TRS-80 "CoCo" and hit play on the cassette recorder to load software. My first creation was a text-adventure game. The thought of an endlessly branching network of if-then decision points creating a beautiful and complicated "behavior" has fascinated me ever since. In those early, heady days (the 80's) I programmed a plotter to write in cursive (script) and built an accounting system for my father while dreaming of installing solenoids and a PC on the lawnmower to mow our expansive yard. I built (and crashed) two RC model airplanes in High School but never had the guts to wire up the controller to the serial port of a PC. The projects I've shared here on github are equally unpolished and unused. But if you find a bit of it interesting send me your questions and I'll be happy to help you get started.

I eventually earned an MS in robotics (Dynamics and Controls) from Georgia Tech and learned how to do engineering and analysis right. One thing I can do well is design, build and maintain a robotic system or discover patterns in data that can be used to predict the future. I was instrumental in building an 10-person team and laboratory for Robotics R&D at one of the largest aerospace corporations in the US. If you need help with these sorts of things, we should talk.
