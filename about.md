My passion for AI was cultivated in a supportive environment of software developers, data scientists, AI enthusiasts, and Go players in Portland Oregon.

### Passion for AI

If you hang around at user groups and Data Science meetups long enough you'll eventually run into a few enthusiasts that love to build neural nets or any old automated or machine learning system. And eventually you start building cool things together. That's what this blog is about.

### PUG -- Python User Group

There are som random bits of [NLP](/pug), data munging, and machine learning code in a "Python User Group" package called pug and [pugnlp](http://github.com/hobson/pugnlp).

It's not maintained very well, but it serves those who know it well.

### NLPIA -- Natural Language Processing in Action

I'm maintaining the [nlpia](http://github.com/hobson/nlpia) package to go along with the book _Natural Language Processing in Action_ published by [Manning](bit.ly/nlpia-py) that Cole, Hannes, and I wrote with the help of our Portland Python friends and mentors.
