We're a bunch of software developers, data scientists, AI enthusiasts, and Go players in Portland Oregon.

### Passion for AI

If you hang around at user groups and Data Science meetups long enough you'll eventually run into a few enthusiasts that love to build neural nets or any old automated or machine learning system. And eventually you start building cool things together. That's what this blog is about.

### PUG

There are som random bits of [NLP](/pug), data munging, and machine learning code in a "Python User Group" package called [pug](http://github.com/hobson/pug).
            
It's not maintained very well, but it serves those who know it well.
